# Project TODO List

This document tracks the necessary improvements and bug fixes for the School Task and Attendance System.
## Student Features
### 1. Clarify and Implement Announcement Attachments

- **Issue:** The functionality for handling and delivering announcement attachments is not fully implemented or clear.
- **Required Fix:**
    1.  **Investigate Current State:** Review the `Announcement` model, schema, and CRUD functions to determine how attachments are currently handled.
    2.  **Implement File Handling:** If necessary, add logic to upload, store, and serve attachment files.
    3.  **Update API Response:** Ensure the announcement-related API endpoints include a URL or other identifier for accessing the attachment.
